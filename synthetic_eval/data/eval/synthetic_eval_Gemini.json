Overall, the aesthetics are decent but could be improved with more attention to detail, a more appealing font, and a more cohesive color scheme relevant to the shop's brand.

ItemDetailPage.css has more sophisticated styling with good use of whitespace. The font choice (Arial) is readable but not particularly stylish. There is no explicit effort to cater to the user's preferred muted colors. The design is functional but lacks a distinct visual identity that would appeal to Ms. Lan. Could benefit from a more cohesive and aesthetically pleasing color scheme and typography, perhaps using lighter pastels or earth tones. The use of photos is good, but the site lacks a clear visual theme tied to art/Vietnam. "

        "Justification": "The click logic for navigation, adding items to the cart, and image carousels is clear and functional. The magnifier feature on the product detail page adds an interactive element. The use of 'aria-label' attributes for accessibility is good practice. The handling of the image gallery and the magnifier appears well-considered."

        "Score": 4,
        "Justification": "The page appears to load quickly based on the code (using static data from a JSON file). The animations are smooth, without any noticeable lag. The magnifier and image transitions appear to handle user input without significant delay.  No asynchronous operations are present in the included code to judge throttling."

        "Justification": "The code is well-structured with clear separation of concerns (components, CSS modules). Components are modularized, reusable, and follow a logical hierarchy. The use of React Router for navigation is good practice. The code is organized into different files, making it easier to understand and maintain."

        "Justification": "The application includes basic functionality like navigation and displaying product information. The image gallery and magnifier are more complex than a simple page, showing a good use of interactivity. There is no state management complexity besides the UI-related states, so the complexity is limited. Could be made more complex by linking to the cart, or adding user settings."
